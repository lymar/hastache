# 0.6.1

- Fixing documentation typos
- Implementing basic context merging (see
  <https://github.com/lymar/hastache/issues/31>)
- `mkGenericContext'` takes an additional `(String -> String)`
  argument which is applied to record field names, much like aeson's
  `fieldLabelModifier`
- Removing unnecessary `utf8-string` dependency
- Implementing the generic context creation for `Maybe` (see
  <https://github.com/lymar/hastache/issues/38> and
  `nestedPolyGenericContextTest` test), `Either`, `()`, and `Version`.
- `mkReadme` is now officially an executable
- Big change: custom extensions for generic contexts (should solve
  #30). See the documentation for `Text.Hastache.Context` and the
  `genericCustom.hs` example.
- Making Hastache work with new base-4.8 (see #41)

# 0.6.0
